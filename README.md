# System-resource-monitoring-on-linux
This project is developed in the C programming language to monitor CPU, RAM, Disk, Network, and process information on Linux-based systems through a Command-Line Interface (CLI).

Compilation Command: gcc main.c core/collector.c core/analyzer.c core/reporter.c ui/cli.c utils/config.c -o minimon

Running Commands: The following commands display the corresponding system resource information in the terminal:

./minimon cli -- Opens the interactive menu interface ./minimon cpu -- Shows CPU usage information ./minimon mem -- Shows RAM (memory) information ./minimon top 5 -- Lists the top 5 processes by CPU usage ./minimon disk -- Shows disk usage and I/O information ./minimon net -- Displays network interfaces and connection count ./minimon report -- Saves system resource information to a CSV file

Note: The top command requires a numeric parameter. For testing: gcc tests/test_collector.c core/collector.c -o test_minimon

Using Commands:

./minimon cpu -- CPU usage information ./minimon mem -- RAM usage information ./minimon top <e.g., 5> -- Top n processes by CPU usage ./minimon disk -- Disk usage and I/O information ./minimon net -- Network data transfer and connection count ./minimon report -- Writes resource information to a CSV file ./minimon cli -- Menu-based user interface

MiniMon Commands:

Ã‡IKTI DOSYASI: The file named system_report.csv is generated by running: ./minimon report

Ubuntu 22.04 was used.
